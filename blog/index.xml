Think of it as the architectural map of a network. The way these components are connected can significantly impact the network&amp;rsquo;s performance, cost, and reliability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this post, we&amp;rsquo;ll explore the most common network topologies with simple diagrams and real-world examples to help you understand how they work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The simplest topology is Point-to-Point (P2P), where a permanent link connects two endpoints directly.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Automating Your Hugo Blog: GitHub Pages Deployment &amp; Playwright Testing</title><link>https://www.vvisveswaran.xyz/blog/github-pages-and-playwright/</link><pubDate>Sat, 14 Dec 2024 20:30:00 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://www.vvisveswaran.xyz/blog/github-pages-and-playwright/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Building a personal portfolio or blog is a rite of passage for many developers. I recently rebuilt my site using &lt;a href="https://gohugo.io/"&gt;Hugo&lt;/a&gt;, a fantastic static site generator known for its speed and flexibility. But hosting the code is only half the battle. I wanted a modern CI/CD pipeline that would:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Automatically deploy&lt;/strong&gt; my site to GitHub Pages whenever I push to &lt;code&gt;main&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Automatically test&lt;/strong&gt; my site to ensure I haven&amp;rsquo;t broken anything before merging changes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this post, I&amp;rsquo;ll walk you through how I set up this automated workflow using &lt;strong&gt;GitHub Actions&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Playwright&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Beginner's Guide to Programming Languages</title><link>https://www.vvisveswaran.xyz/blog/20240502t082832/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 May 2024 09:00:00 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://www.vvisveswaran.xyz/blog/20240502t082832/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Programming is a valuable skill across many industries and professions today. This guide will introduce you to four popular programming languages—Java, Python, JavaScript, and Ruby—highlighting their unique features, applications, and why they are great choices for beginners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="java"&gt;Java&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="overview"&gt;Overview&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Java, developed by Sun Microsystems in the mid-90s, is a robust, object-oriented language. It’s designed to be portable across multiple platforms, meaning Java programs can run on any device that has the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) installed. This &amp;ldquo;write once, run anywhere&amp;rdquo; philosophy makes it a popular choice for developers.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Purpose</title><link>https://www.vvisveswaran.xyz/blog/20240502t082704/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 May 2024 08:00:00 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://www.vvisveswaran.xyz/blog/20240502t082704/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;I get this question from my friends when I pitch the idea of a Blog &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;There are a lot of blogs available in the internet.

&lt;p&gt;Comming from a small town in Southern India I learnt to program from a young age. I was learning GW BASIC for a good 6 years. That was from Standard 6 all the way till Standard 12. Back them computers were inducted into the schools as a curriculum. Where students had to remove their shoes and go next to a &lt;em&gt;very costly machine&lt;/em&gt; .&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
